    <h1>Postcards from friends</h1>
    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>
      This is a collection of the different postcards I've received from
      friends. At some point I decided to start sending people postcards rather
      than buying them souvenirs. I really wanted to experience that delight
      myself, so I've begged people for postcards every time they go overseas.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wanted to ensure they were archived safely, so I've made this website to
      preserve them even in case I lose some of them over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enjoy clicking through them; I hope this might inspire you to take the
      plunge to send your own postcards :)
